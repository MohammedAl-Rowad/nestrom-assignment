#### How to run the api ( I used NestJs ) 
* nodejs version: `v10.16.0`

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/MohammedAl-Rowad/nestrom-assignment.git
$ cd api
$ npm i
# pls go to app.module.ts and update the connection string ( sorry I didn't use .env files... ) line 12
$ npm run start:dev
```
* go to `actors.controller.ts` - `movies.controller.ts` - `director.controller.ts` to see the CRUD routes
